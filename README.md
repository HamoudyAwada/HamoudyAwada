# Hey, It's Moe!

My name is Mohamad Awada, but I also go by Moe if that floats yor boat, and I'm an aspiring UX/UI designer!

I'm a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, or [**SAIT**](https://www.sait.ca/) for short. I'm studying [Interactive Design](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/interactive-design-user-experience) with a specialization in UX and UI. I'm very passionate about technology and how we can work toward people centered design. I'm still learning a lot, but I am always actively working to expand my portfolio and am completely open to be a part of any project!

I'm open to any and all opportunites that come my way and am eager to be able to contribute to industry with my ever developing skill set and ambition for a bright future! My **portfolio** and **contact information** are attached over a variety of sources below. Please reach out if you'd like to get in touch to extend an opportunity, or just say hello! I love meeting new people and building connections, and I think that's one of the things that makes life so enriching. Now for a little bit about me personally!

Aside from my studies, I enjoy almost all things creative! I have a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@moetif) which I admittedly don't post on enough to call it a legitimate attempt at self expression yet, but I'm working on that! I've also enjoyed painting in the past and I have particularly come to enjoy painting on glass! I am learning more about areas related to any form of digital media! I am ambitious about a career involoving the creative aspects of myself that will allow me to incorporate what I'm truly passionate about with my work. In the near future, I will be able to say that I have begun putting all of myself into the areas that I want to focus on, and I hope to be able to be proud enough in my own work to start sharing it with the rest of the world!

Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. Please reach out and say hi. I'd love to connect!
