# Hey, It's Moe!

My name is Mohamad Awada and I'm an aspiring UX/UI designer!

I am a student at the Sothern Alberta Institute of Technology, or [**SAIT**](https://www.sait.ca/) for short. I'm studying interactive design with a specialization in UX and UI. I'm very passionate about technology and what it can do for people and how we can work toward people centered design. I'm still learning a lot but I am always actively working to expand my portfolio and be a part of new projects!

I'm open to any and all opportunites that come my way and am eager to be able to contribute to industry with my ever developing skill set and ambition for a bright future! I have **portfolio** and **contact information** attached over a variety of sources below. Please reach out if you'd like to get in touch to extend an opportunity, or just say hello! I love meeting new people and building connections and I think that's one of the things that makes life so enriching. Now for a little bit about me personally
